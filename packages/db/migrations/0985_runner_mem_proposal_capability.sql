-- D#601 MEM-6: the runner's memory-proposal capability.
--
-- A tenth runner capability, 'mem_proposal_v1': a runner that listed it may send, on the memory-proposals route, the proposals a person said yes to at a terminal after a run ended; the cloud takes them in as pending
-- entries through the same intake as any proposal. It gates no role and changes nothing for a runner without it. The table's CHECK and runner_capabilities_record's closed list widen by one value, from
-- {'proposal_verifier', 'wake_v1', 'plane_merge_v1', 'memory_limit_v1', 'plane_merge_queue_v1', 'discovery_analyst', 'conflict_facts_v1', 'ordered_facts_v1', 'tip_publish_v1'} (0980); everything else of the function is
-- 0980's, verbatim (same signature, owner, pinned search_path, grants and the ADMIN-option bracket).
--
-- Expand-only: a CHECK and a closed list widen by one value. A value is never removed from either in place. The number is the next free one above main's highest (0982) and the numbers open work holds (0983, 0984);
-- the Team Lead re-checks it at merge, and merges go in number order.
