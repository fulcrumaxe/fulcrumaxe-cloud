-- D#749 V2c-1: the thirteenth runner capability, 'browser_playwright_v1'.
--
-- A runner that drives its own Playwright browser for the post-merge deploy verifier (the model works through the runner-owned `fxverify` MCP server) says so on its hello. The cloud then offers it
-- a deploy verifier job whose signed `browser_method` is `playwright_runner`; a job signed `chrome_runner` still needs 'browser_chrome_v1' (1004). Like 1004's two codes it widens no permission: it only
-- narrows what a claim offers, and a cloud that predates it refuses the code on the hello (400), so the runner drops it and offers nothing.
--
-- Expand-only: runner_capabilities_values_check and runner_capabilities_record's closed list widen by one value, from the twelve of 1004; everything else of the function is 1004's, verbatim (same
-- signature, owner, pinned search_path, grants and the ADMIN-option bracket). The number is the next free one above main's highest (1005); the Team Lead re-checks it at merge, and merges go in number order.
