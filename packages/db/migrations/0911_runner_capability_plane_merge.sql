-- D#6 PUBLIC-MERGE PR2a: a third runner capability, 'plane_merge_v1'.
--
-- A runner that lists 'plane_merge_v1' on its hello can claim and execute a merge order (0910). The hello rewrites runner_capabilities on every call (0893),
-- so the stored set must accept the new code: the table's CHECK and runner_capabilities_record's closed list both widen from {'proposal_verifier', 'wake_v1'}
-- to {'proposal_verifier', 'wake_v1', 'plane_merge_v1'}. The capability gates no role, so what a claim offers is unchanged. No runner build lists it yet.
--
-- Nothing else moves: same signature, owner (runner_capabilities_definer), pinned search_path and grants; the ownership bracket is 0893's and 0895's.
-- Expand-only: a CHECK and a closed list widen by one value. Numbered above 0910; re-check before the pull request is opened and before merging.
