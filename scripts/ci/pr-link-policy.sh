#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/ci/pr-link-policy.sh — enforce how a PR body is allowed to cite the
# Discussion it came from (D#2348 PR-h item 1).
#
# TWO RULES, ONE REASON
#
#   1. The body must carry a machine-readable Discussion reference in the
#      `D#NNNN` form — either a closing one (Closes/Resolves/Fixes) or an
#      advancing one (Refs/Part of/Towards).
#   2. The body must not contain a `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URL naming any
#      repo other than the code plane's own, or one named in
#      $PR_LINK_POLICY_ALLOW_REPOS (default: fulcrumaxe/fulcrumaxe, the public
#      engine repo).
#
# Both come out of the same decision: PRs become public, Discussions stay
# private. A public PR body that links a private Discussion by URL publishes
# a 404 that also leaks shape — that a private twin exists, roughly how much
# work is in it, and how it is numbered. A bare `Closes D#2348` is honest
# about provenance and publishes neither a dead link nor a hostname.
#
# RULE 1 IS ABOUT PROVENANCE, NOT CLOSURE (D#2401)
#
# The reasoning above — provenance, no dead link, no leaked hostname — is
# satisfied exactly as well by `Refs D#2401` as by `Closes D#2401`. Nothing in
# it requires the reference to be a *closing* one, so rule 1 originally
# conflated two different requirements: "every PR names its Discussion" (the
# actual reason this gate exists) and "every PR closes a Discussion" (never
# the reason, and a PR that only advances a multi-PR Discussion could not say
# so honestly). D#2401 split them apart: rule 1 now accepts either verb class.
#
# This gives up nothing on premature closes. That protection was never this
# gate's job — it lives in `planned_prs` plus
# `scripts/lib/discussion-close-guard.sh::discussion_close_decision`, which
# holds on unknown and is unchanged by this. Whether a Discussion closes is
# decided there, after merge, from the Discussion body — never from which verb
# a PR body happened to use.
#
# The advancing verbs are accepted ONLY in the `D#` form, never bare `#N`.
# `Refs #123` is an ordinary cross-reference to a PR or Issue on the code
# plane, and reading it as Discussion 123 would silently resolve to the wrong
# thing. The closing verbs keep their existing `(D#|#)` behaviour — unchanged,
# relied on elsewhere (an Issue closed via `Closes #N`).
#
# WHY PRE-MERGE IS ENOUGH HERE, AND ONLY HERE
#
# A PR body is not a published artifact: it can be edited afterwards with no
# residue. A commit cannot, which is why the identifier scan that guards
# commit content is a separate, pre-push mechanism (D#2348 PR-g) rather than
# another job in this workflow.
#
# RULE 2 COMPARES THE FULL owner/repo, NOT JUST THE OWNER
#
# Rule 2 first compared only the owner. That is enough while the private and
# public planes have different owners, and not enough once they share one: a
# project whose private Discussion repo and public code repo sit under the same
# owner would let a link into the private repo's Discussions pass, because its
# owner equals the code plane's. The comparison is therefore on owner/repo, and
# an allowlist (above) names the few other repos a body may link.
# A link that names an owner but no repo (a profile link) is judged on the owner
# alone, since there is no repo in it to be foreign.
#
# RULE 2 IS AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A DENYLIST — AND NEEDS NO PRIVATE NAME
#
# This gate runs on the public code plane, which never contains a private
# owner name to hunt (the old denylist form read IDENTIFIER-RULES.txt, which
# open-source/export.sh deliberately excludes from the export — so the gate
# needed a name that could never exist in the tree it ran in, and failed
# closed on every PR the public repo has ever had). Rule 2 instead compares
# against the code plane's OWN owner: a URL naming any other owner is
# rejected. The public owner is, by definition, safe to write down and to
# resolve at run time — no secret, no export-excluded file.
#
# This is also strictly stronger than the old rule: it catches a link into
# *any* foreign repo, not just the one owner it happened to be told about,
# and it keeps working across a rename.
#
# CODE REPO RESOLUTION, FIRST HIT WINS
#
#   1. $PR_LINK_POLICY_CODE_REPO — an explicit "owner/name" override, for the
#      test suite and for local runs that want to pin the answer.
#      $PR_LINK_POLICY_CODE_OWNER — the older, owner-only override. It still
#      works and then allows any repo under that owner, which is the behaviour
#      it always had; prefer the full form.
#   2. $GITHUB_REPOSITORY — "owner/name" of the *base* repo on a pull_request
#      event. This is the source that makes the gate decidable on a fork PR:
#      it is a plain environment variable, not an Actions secret, so GitHub
#      populates it on workflow runs triggered by a fork's pull_request event
#      (secrets are withheld there by design). A secret-backed owner would
#      leave the gate undecidable on exactly the external-contributor PRs the
#      public code plane exists to accept.
#   3. code_repo from .autonomous-team/config.json (the full "owner/name") — local and private-plane
#      runs only. Never the only source: that directory is excluded from the
#      export, so it does not exist in the tree this gate runs in on the
#      public plane.
#   4. Otherwise this FAILS — it does not skip. A gate that cannot name what
#      it is comparing against must not report a pass; that is the specific
#      defect (SKIP-on-missing-input) this cutover has already shipped three
#      times.
#
# HOST MATCHING IS EXACT AND SCHEME-AGNOSTIC — NOT A SUBDOMAIN WILDCARD AND
# NOT A BARE SUBSTRING
#
# Only the host "github.com" (a leading "www." is tolerated) is treated as a
# repo URL. "*.github.com" is deliberately NOT matched: docs.github.com/en/...
# would parse "en" as an owner and reject a documentation link — a realistic
# false positive on a PR about CI, and false positives are how a guardrail
# gets routed around.
#
# The match does not require a URL scheme, because the exact case this gate
# exists to catch doesn't carry one: "Context: github.com/some-private-org/
# enginerepo/discussions/2438" (D#2438's own motivating example). A pattern
# that required "https?://" would pass that clean. But dropping the scheme
# requirement and grepping for the bare substring "github.com/" reopens a
# DIFFERENT false positive: "notgithub.com/someowner" and "mygithub.com/
# someowner" both contain that substring. The fix that closes the scheme gap
# without reopening the substring gap is to extract the FULL contiguous
# hostname-like token around any "github.com" occurrence (greedy on both
# sides — "notgithub.com" and "docs.github.com" both extract in full, not
# just their "github.com" tail) and require that whole token to equal
# "github.com" or "www.github.com" exactly, case-insensitively, before an
# owner check ever runs on it. A token that differs by even one leading or
# trailing character is a different host and is never treated as a GitHub
# URL — scheme or no scheme. See has_foreign_repo_url() for the two-step
# implementation (POSIX/bash regex has no lookbehind to anchor this in one
# pattern).
#
# Known gap, accepted rather than silently dropped: this still does not
# match a github.com *subdomain* — gist.github.com/<owner>/... included —
# because its full hostname token differs from "github.com" the same way
# "docs.github.com" does. Same tradeoff scripts/ci/publish-denylist.sh makes
# for its rename blind spot — a realistic false positive costs more than a
# false negative nobody here produces. Not gold-plated into a subdomain
# allowlist to close it.
#
# INPUT — $PR_BODY_FILE IN CI, $PR_BODY ONLY FOR LOCAL USE
#
# In CI the body arrives as a FILE whose path is named by $PR_BODY_FILE, and
# the workflow fills that file from $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH. It is deliberately
# not passed through the step's `env:` block, which is how this first shipped
# and was wrong in the worst way available: the runner prints a step's env
# block into the log before the step runs, so a body containing the private
# slug got published verbatim into a public Actions log — permanently, and
# only on the bodies this gate exists to catch. This script's redaction of
# its own output was correct and arrived 36ms too late to matter. The fix is
# to keep the body out of anything the runner echoes, not to redact harder.
#
# It is also never interpolated into a `run:` line: on a fork PR the body is
# attacker-controlled text and splicing it into a shell command is an
# injection hole.
#
# $PR_BODY is still honoured when $PR_BODY_FILE is unset, for local runs and
# for the test suite. Neither set is a wiring error (exit 2). An EMPTY body is
# a real PR with an empty body and fails rule 1 like any other body with no
# Discussion reference.
#
# Usage:
#   PR_BODY_FILE=/path/to/body.txt bash scripts/ci/pr-link-policy.sh
#   PR_BODY="$(gh pr view 123 --json body -q .body)" bash scripts/ci/pr-link-policy.sh
#
# Exit 0 = both rules satisfied.
# Exit 1 = a rule is violated, the code repo could not be resolved, or the
#          self-test failed.
# Exit 2 = neither input is set, the named file is unreadable, or too many
#          arguments.

# Rule 2's pattern is scheme-agnostic on purpose: D#2438's own motivating
# example ("Context: github.com/some-private-org/enginerepo/discussions/2438")
# has no "https://" at all, and the old denylist was a bare substring match
# that caught it regardless of scheme. A pattern that required a scheme would
# pass that exact case clean — a real hole, not a theoretical one.
#
# The fix is NOT to drop the host anchor and grep for the substring
# "github.com/" — that reopens the false-positive this design exists to
# avoid: "notgithub.com/someowner" and "mygithub.com/someowner" both contain
# "github.com/someowner" as a substring, and under an allowlist a substring
# hit on an unrelated host is a false positive that blocks a legitimate PR.
#
# So the match is done in two steps instead of one regex: grep extracts the
# FULL contiguous hostname-like token surrounding any "github.com" occurrence
# — greedy on both sides, so "notgithub.com" extracts as "notgithub.com" in
# full and "docs.github.com" extracts as "docs.github.com" in full, not just
# the "github.com" tail — and only THEN is that whole token compared for
# exact (case-insensitive) equality against "github.com" or "www.github.com".
# A token that differs by so much as one leading or trailing character, on
# either side, is a different host and is never treated as a GitHub URL at
