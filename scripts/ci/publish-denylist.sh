# scripts/ci/publish-denylist.sh — fail a PR that ADDS a path which must
# never reach the published tree (D#2348 PR-h item 2).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# open-source/MANIFEST.md's "Explicitly excluded" list is enforced today by
# four checks that all run against a PRODUCED EXPORT TREE
# (shipped-to-listed.sh, shipped-dir-inventory.sh, shipped-extensions.sh,
# tracked-provenance.sh). Once development happens in the public repo there
# is no export tree to audit — the repository is the artifact — so the same
# list has to be re-expressed as a gate over the diff. That is this file. It
# collapses those four into one because they were four answers to a single
# question: did anything land where it must not land.
#
# SUBJECT: ADDED PATHS ONLY, NOT THE TREE
#
# This is a diff gate, deliberately. .env.example and 1801 files under
# archive/ are already tracked and are supposed to stay tracked — the
# private repo keeps archive/ and .autonomous-team/ by the same owner
# decision that put this gate here. A tree-wide scan would be red on every
# PR forever, which is a gate that gets switched off. The question this
# answers is "did THIS PR put something new there", which is the question
# with an actionable answer.
#
# RENAME HANDLING — a documented, deliberate blind spot
#
# git's rename detection is left ON (the default). A pure `git mv` of an
# existing file into a denied prefix is therefore reported as R, not A, and
# does not fail this gate. That is a real hole and it is chosen: CLAUDE.md's
# Archive Protocol REQUIRES `git mv` into archive/<name>-<date>/ and forbids
# `git rm`, so a gate that reddened on every protocol-compliant archive move
# would be red on exactly the PRs that are doing the right thing. Over-
# blocking is how a guardrail gets routed around. What still fails: new
# content written under a denied prefix, and a move so heavily edited that
# git scores it below the rename-similarity threshold (a 50%-changed file
# comes through as A+D).
#
# NO SELF-EXCLUSION LIST, ON PURPOSE
#
# The sibling gates in this directory carry a SCAN_EXCLUDE_PREFIXES block
# because they scan file CONTENT and would otherwise flag their own pattern
# data. This one reads PATHS. Its own path (scripts/ci/) and its test's
# (tests/) are not denied by any rule below, so it cannot trip on itself and
# needs no carve-out — a carve-out here would be a hole with no reason.
#
# SELF-TEST ON EVERY RUN
#
# Three gates in this cutover shipped in a state where they could not fail,
# and all three were found by a person going to look rather than by anything
# going red. So this file runs its own classifier against a fixed set of
# paths that MUST be denied and paths that MUST be allowed before it looks
# at the real diff, and aborts if any verdict is wrong. A clean repository
# and a broken classifier no longer look the same from the outside.
#
# OPTIONAL PROJECT OVERLAY — scripts/ci/publish-denylist.local
#
# A project may keep extra denied paths in scripts/ci/publish-denylist.local,
# next to this script, one `<path><TAB><authority>` per line. An entry ending in
# `/` is a prefix, any other entry is an exact path, no globs, and a whole line
# starting with `#` is a comment. The file is read ONLY IF IT EXISTS; the
# built-in list below is always in force, and a missing file is the normal case
# (the public side of a two-plane project does not carry it, because the list
# itself names private folders). A malformed line fails the run: a half-read
# overlay would silently allow what it failed to read. Every entry is added to
# the self-test as a path that MUST be denied. The built-in MUST_ALLOW probes
# are checked against the built-in rules only, so an overlay that denies a whole
# directory cannot make them contradict it.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/ci/publish-denylist.sh [base-ref]
#
# base-ref defaults to $PUBLISH_DENYLIST_BASE, then to origin/main. It is
# resolved against the repository in the current working directory, which is
# what makes this testable against a fixture repo (cd into it) rather than
# only against the live tree.
#
# Exit 0 = no added path is under a denied rule.
# Exit 1 = at least one added path is denied, the base ref does not resolve,
#          the diff could not be computed, or the self-test failed. There is
#          deliberately no SKIP branch: a gate that cannot measure must not
#          report a pass.
# Exit 2 = usage error.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The denylist. Source: D#2348 PR-h item 2, reconciled against
# open-source/MANIFEST.md's "Explicitly excluded" section and against the
# owner's final push-set decision recorded on D#2348. Two reconciliations
# are worth writing down here rather than leaving in a PR description:
#
#   1. The Spec writes "gemma-sandbox/". No such path exists at the repo
#      root — the directory is scripts/gemma-sandbox/ (6 tracked files), and
#      that is how MANIFEST.md and scripts/ci/repo-target-gate.sh both spell
#      it. Implementing the Spec's spelling literally would have produced a
#      rule that can never match, which is the precise defect this Spec item
#      exists to prevent. Both spellings are listed: the real one so the
#      rule fires, the root one so a future top-level directory of that name
#      is not a silent gap.
#
#   2. The owner's final push set also excludes wiki/, open-source/,
#      docker/, systemd/, verification-report/, templates/ and
#      dashboard_tui/. Those are NOT here. They are "exists in this repo,
#      does not ship", not "must never exist" — wiki/ is written to by
#      docs-writer and open-source/ is edited by this Discussion's own
#      remaining PRs, so denying additions to them would block ordinary
#      private-repo work today for a publishing rule that only binds at push
#      time. Enforcing the push set is PR-l's job and it enforces it on the
#      push, which is where it belongs.

# Matched against the whole path, not just the basename, so a file inside a
# directory such as .envs/ is caught too. rsync's own guard in
# open-source/lib/rsync-excludes.sh is spelled the same way and matches path
# components for the same reason.
DENIED_GLOB="*.env*"

# One carve-out from that glob, decided rather than inherited. `*.env*` exists
# to stop credentials; `.env.example` is the documented opposite of a
# credential file — the tracked one at the repo root carries exactly two
# credential lines and both are commented out. It is also on PR-l's seed path,
# so leaving the bare glob in place would have decided, as a side effect of a
# pattern, that this project ships no example environment file at all. That is
# a decision worth making on purpose or not at all.
#
# The carve-out is an EXACT BASENAME match, not a suffix match. `backend/.env.example`
# is allowed because its basename is `.env.example`; `prod.env.example` and
# `.env.example.bak` are still denied, because a suffix rule would let any
# file be smuggled through by renaming it. Both directions are in the
# self-test below so the boundary is asserted rather than described.
